# SilentCaptcha Tool

It is a tool that automates the solving of CAPTCHAs to perform brute-force attacks on login pages. It solves CAPTCHAs on websites protected with Google reCAPTCHA, using Selenium and the noCaptcha extension. It is ideal for educational and research purposes in controlled environments, enabling brute-force attacks and bypassing CAPTCHA protection since the solving process is automated with this bot.
